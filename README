# LSDB

Librestack database wrapper for LMDB.

Early alpha work in progress.  DO NOT USE.

By creating a wrapper for LMDB that exactly copies the API, we make our database
drop-in compatible with LMDB.  Having done this, we can start adding additional
functionality by extending the API, while still retaining complete compatibility
with the base LMDB.

## TODO

- indexing functions (formerly part of Librecast)
- multicast database replication
- network queries
- async mode
